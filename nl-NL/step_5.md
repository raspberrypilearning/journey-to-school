## Test your model

+ Click on **Back to project** to go back to the project page, then click on **Train** to go back to the **Train** page.

+ Choose one of the survey responses that you entered earlier. Write down all of the values of the survey response on a piece of paper, then delete the response from the bucket. To delete the response, hover the mouse cursor over the response, then click on the red cross that appears. ![Deleting and entry from your data](images/delete-entry.png) --- /task ---

+ Click on **Train new machine learning model**, as you did before. --- /task ---

+ Once the new model has finished the training, take the values that you have written down and enter them into the Test boxes.

You know the right answer for this test — it is the bucket that you deleted the example from. Compare the computer’s prediction with the right answer. Did the computer get it right? --- /task ---

You have now tested your predictive machine learning model to see how accurate it is. You asked the computer for the answer to a question that it hadn't seen before (because you had deleted the example from the computer's training before the test). If you test the computer on an example that it has seen before, and that it has therefore learned from in its training, then you can’t really tell if the computer has learned how to work out the answer for itself.

+ But how fair a test was it?
+ Did you choose a really easy example? (Like a student who lives a really, really long way from school!)
+ Or did you choose a really hard example?
+ How could you have chosen an example to make it fair?
