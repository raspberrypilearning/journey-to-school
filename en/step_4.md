## Train a new machine learning model
Now, you will use your survey results to train the computer.

+ Click on **Back to project** in the top left-hand corner to take you back to the project page. Then, click on **Learn & Test** to use your examples.

+ Click the **Train new machine learning model** button. It should only take a few seconds to train.

Once the training has finished, a Test box should appear. Use this to test your model.
+ Enter the values into the Test text boxes and click on **Test**.

+ Keep testing to try to work out the patterns that the computer has seen in your survey data.

As you make the age higher, does the computer think walking becomes more likely than going by car? If so, what is the age where the computer seems to have seen the change?

You have now used numbers from a travel survey to train a simple machine learning model.
You have created a **predictive model** (called a predictive model because we use models like this to make predictions).
You could use this model to make predictions about how likely someone is to walk to school based on their age and how far from school they live. But how accurate are the predictions? You will test that in the next step.
