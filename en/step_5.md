## Test your model

--- task ---
+ Click on the **“< Back to project”** link and then go back into the **Train** page

+ Choose one of the survey responses you entered earlier, and delete it. 
**Make sure you write down all of the values for the example you are deleting before you delete it.**
We’ll need the values in a minute. Hover the mouse pointer over it, until the red cross appears. Click on that red cross to delete the example.

You know what the right answer for this is – it’s the bucket that you deleted this example from. Compare the computer’s prediction with the right answer. Did the computer get it right?

You’ve tested your predictive machine learning model to see how accurate it is.
By deleting the example from the computer’s training first, it means you tested it by asking it for the answer to a question it hadn’t seen before.
(If you test it on an example that it has seen before – that it has had to learn from in it’s training – then you can’t really tell if the computer has learned how to work out the answer for itself.)
But how fair a test was it?
Did you choose a really easy example? (Like a student who lives a really really long way from school!) Or did you choose a really hard example?
How could you have chosen an example to make it fair?
