## Create new project to recognise numbers

For this project, you will need to do a survey with your classmates. The more people you can ask, the better! **If you are not able to run a survey, that's no problem. You can find sample results [here](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/journey-to-school/tree/draft/en/resources){:target="_blank"}**

--- task ---
+ Write 2 or 3 questions you could ask your classmates that could affect how they travel to school. You need questions that they can answer with a number. For the rest of this worksheet, we’ll use:
Age (in years)
Distance (miles from home to school)
Number of siblings or school friends who live nearby
But you can choose your own values. Make sure that they are numbers, and pick things that could possibly have something to do with their journey to school.

+ Draw up a table to collect the results, and then go do your survey. Remember to ask how they travel to school as well as your questions. The more children you ask, the better. If you can ask children from different classes and years, even better.
