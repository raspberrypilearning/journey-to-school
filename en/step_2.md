## Create a new project to recognise numbers

For this project, you will need to do a survey with your classmates. The more people you ask, the better! **Note:** If you cannot run a survey, that's OK. You can [find sample results here](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/journey-to-school/en/resources){:target="_blank"}.

--- task ---

Write two or three questions to ask your classmates about how they travel to school. You need questions that they can answer with a number. You could use:
+ Age (in years)
+ Distance (miles from home to school)
+ Number of siblings or school friends who live nearby

But you can choose your own values. Make sure that the answers are numbers, and pick things that have something to do with their journey to school.

Draw up a table to collect the results, and then do your survey. Ask your classmates how they travel to school, as well as your questions. The more people you ask, the better. It is even better if you can ask people from different classes and years.
