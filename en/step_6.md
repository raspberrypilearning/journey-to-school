## Challenge: use your model in Scratch

--- challenge ---
Now that you’ve finished, why not give one of these ideas a try?
Or come up with one of your own?

+ **Try using this in Scratch**
Can you think of a way to use the computer’s ability to predict
how people travel to school in a game? Click **Make** to use your model in Scratch.

+ **Try bigger tests**
Instead of just deleting one example from the training data and using that to test, try using more examples.
How many do you think you should use for testing?
If you use too few to test, you can’t be sure how good the computer is.
If you use too many to test, you’re reducing how many examples the computer has to actually learn from.
